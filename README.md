# Short_scripts.c
This repository contains subdirectories and files with short coding scripts in C language. The purpose of this repository is to complile very simple functions (such as the print function) in a file or run short scripts (such as for/while loops) in C language.


There are three directories numbered 1-3 here. Each one contains a set of files numbered p0(1-5 or more) that contain very simple code in C as well as a skel.c file. The latter contains the fewest essential functions in order to start writing simple scripts in C. The rest of the scripts (p01-p05 or more) in each folder have been made by building on the initial skel.c file. As the file number progresses (e.g. moving from p03.c to p04.c) the script becomes more complex. Accordingly, moving from directory 1/ towards 2/ and then 3/ the scripts become again more complex. The last scripts thet are included in directory 3/ (e.g. p03.c and p04.c) can complete some simple processes like finding the CG% content in a DNA sequence (p03.c) or replacing hydrophobic aminoacids with symbols in a protein sequence (p04.c). For more details on each script plase see the individual README files that can be found in each directory.
