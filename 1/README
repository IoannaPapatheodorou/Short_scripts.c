README 1/

This directory contains a list of C files named p0(1-8).c as well as a skel.c file. The skel.c file contains the fewest and simplest essential functions for the rest of the scripts. All p??.c files are based on the skel.c file. The scripts become more enriched while moving from p01.c toward p08.c.

Contents/titles of the p??.c files:

  p01.c and p02.c: prints "Hello world!"
  p03.c: prints the values of an integer and a float number
  p04.c: requests two numbers and then prints their values
  p05.c: for loop - prints the square root of x
  p06.c: while loop - prints the square root of x
  p07.c: for loop with nested if - prints the square root of x
  p08.c: for loop with nested if/else - prints the square root of x
