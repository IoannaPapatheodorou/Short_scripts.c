README 3/

This directory contains a list of C files named p0(1-4).c as well as a skel.c file. The skel.c file contains the fewest and simplest essential functions for the rest of the scripts. All p??.c files are based on the skel.c file. The scripts become more enriched while moving from p01.c toward p07.c.

Contents of the p??.c files:

p01.c: introduction to seq[] and strlen() - prints the length of a sequence

p02.c: performs the same task as p01.c but in a while loop

p03.c: scans a seq[] and finds the GC% content

p04.c: scans a protein sequence and replaces every type of aminoacid with a different symbol (e.g. hydrophobic aminoacids are replaced with *)
