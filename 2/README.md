This directory contains a list of C files named p0(1-7).c as well as a skel.c file. The skel.c file contains the fewest and simplest essential functions for the rest of the scripts. All p??.c files are based on the skel.c file. The scripts become more enriched while moving from p01.c toward p07.c.

Contents of the p??.c files:


  p01.c: requests two numbers and prints their values
  
  p02.c: attibutes scanf to a and performs the same task as p01.c
  
  p03.c: introduction to characters (char) - prints a char value
  
  p04.c: char in a while loop
  
  p05.c: detects the number of cytocines in a sequence using a while loop
  
  p06.c: detects the CG% in a seuence using a while loop
  
  p07.c: scans and prints three characters
